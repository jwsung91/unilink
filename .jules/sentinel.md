## 2026-02-05 - [DoS: Tight Loop in Async Accept]
**Vulnerability:** A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability where the TCP server would enter a tight loop consuming 100% CPU when the client limit was reached. The server would reject a connection (close socket) and immediately restart the async accept operation, processing the pending OS backlog as fast as possible without backoff.
**Learning:** In Boost.Asio (and async IO in general), rejecting a connection and immediately re-issuing an accept call creates a spin loop if the backlog is full. The OS is ready to hand over the next connection instantly.
**Prevention:** Implement a "pause" mechanism. When the server is full (or overloaded), stop issuing new `async_accept` calls. Resume accepting only when resources become available (e.g., a client disconnects). This allows the OS backlog to fill up naturally, eventually causing the OS to drop SYN packets, which is the correct backpressure behavior for a saturated server.
